There are 2 CSV files, books_amazon_output.csv and books_millions_output.csv. They contain data about books extracted from the websites amazon.com and booksamillion.com. Following are the attributes in each of these files:

Name: Title of the book
Category: Category of the book (Ex: In these tables, we have extracted data for books limited to categories Space Opera, Dark Fantasy and Psychological Thrillers)
Author: Author(s) of the book
Price: Cost of the book
Series: Series of the book
Pages: Number of pages in the book

Weight: Shipping weight of the book 

Some attributes are sparsely populated. For example: Series and Language columns are empty in books_millions_output.csv. Also, Dimensions and Weight are sparsely populated in it as compared to books_amazon_output.csv. We can deal with these columns in the later stage (like dropiing empty columns in entity matching)

Number of tuples in books_amazon_output.csv = 2990
Number of tuples in books_millions_output.csv = 9420
