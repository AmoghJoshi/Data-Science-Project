to take this to its, er, "logical" conclusion, it is impossible to
ascertain whether or not i am a better hitter than <>Roberto Alomar</>,
or a better pitcher than <>Juan Guzman</>, or a better center fielder than
<>Devon White</>.  after all, if i were on the blue jays, can you really
prove that they wouldn't have won the world series in both 1991 AND
while i thank you, mister <>Maynard</>, for your faith in my atheletic
prowess, i can assure you that your faith is misplaced.
